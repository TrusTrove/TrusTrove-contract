## Testnet Limitations

### Friendbot-Derived Accounts

Testnet accounts are funded via Friendbot, which provides a fixed amount of
test XLM. All USDC on testnet is issued by the testnet USDC issuer and has no
real-world value. This means:

- **No real economic incentives** are at play — behaviour on testnet may not
  reflect mainnet dynamics.
- **Friendbot rate limits** can slow down testing. If `setup-testnet.sh`
  returns a `400` from Friendbot, the account is likely already funded
  (the error is benign).

### Ephemeral Validators

Stellar testnet validators may reset state periodically. Do not depend on
testnet contract state for production data.

### No Formal Audit

All contracts are unaudited. See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#audit-status)
for details.

### Deprecated Test CLI Commands

The `stellar contract` subcommand used in deploy scripts may change with CLI
upgrades. The repository pins `Rust 1.85.0` and the `wasm32v1-none` target,
but the Stellar CLI is expected to be at the latest version
(see [DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md#prerequisites)).

## Gas & Budget

### Soroban Resource Model

Soroban charges fees based on a budget model: each operation consumes
CPU instructions, memory, and ledger I/O. The following are approximate
relative costs based on code analysis.

| Operation | Cross-Contract Calls | Token Transfers | CPU Instructions | Memory (Bytes) | Relative Budget |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| `registry::register_issuer` | 0 | 0 | — | — | Very Low |
| `registry::revoke` | 0 | 0 | — | — | Very Low |
| `registry::get_profile_count` | 0 | 0 | — | — | Very Low |
| `registry::list_profiles` | 0 | 0 | — | — | Low (O(limit), ≤ 50) |
| `invoice::create` | 2 (`is_verified` ×2) | 0 | — | — | Low |
| `invoice::batch_create` | 2 per entry (`is_verified` ×2) | 0 | — | — | Low per entry, **up to 50× `create`** |
| `invoice::list_for_financing` | 0 | 0 | — | — | Low |
| `invoice::batch_list_for_financing` | 0 | 0 | — | — | Low per entry, **up to 50× `list_for_financing`** |
| `invoice::mark_funded` | 0 | 0 | — | — | Low |
| `invoice::repay` | 1 (`receive_repayment`) | 1 (buyer → pool) | — | — | Medium |
| `invoice::trigger_default` | 1 (`handle_default`) | 0 | — | — | Medium |
| `pool::deposit` (before refactor) | 0 | 1 (LP → pool) | ~456,800 | ~73,400 | Low-Medium |
| `pool::deposit` (after `mint()`) | 0 | 1 (LP → pool) | 457,992 | 73,495 | Low-Medium |
| `pool::withdraw` (before refactor) | 0 | 1 (pool → LP) | ~450,500 | ~63,550 | Medium |
| `pool::withdraw` (after `burn()`) | 0 | 1 (pool → LP) | 451,634 | 63,660 | Medium |
| `pool::fund_invoice` | 6 (`get_status`, `get_funding_asset`, `get_face_value`, `get_discount_bps`, `lock`, `mark_funded`) | 1 (pool → escrow) | — | — | **High** |
| `pool::batch_fund_invoice` | 6 per entry | 1 per entry | — | — | **High** per entry, **up to 50× `fund_invoice`** |
| `pool::receive_repayment` | 0 | 0 | — | — | Low |
| `pool::handle_default` | 1 (`escrow::handle_default`) | 1 (escrow → pool) | — | — | Medium |
| `pool_factory::register_existing_pool` | 0 | 0 | 69,486 | 7,604 | Low |
| `escrow::lock` | 0 | 1 (pool → escrow) | — | — | Medium |
| `escrow::release_to_issuer` | 0 | 1 (escrow → issuer) | — | — | Medium |
| `escrow::release_to_pool` | 0 | 1 (escrow → pool, partial allowed) | — | — | Medium |
| `escrow::handle_default` | 0 | 1 (escrow → pool) | — | — | Medium |

Every mutating entry point above also reads the shared pause flag
(`trusttrove-pause`), adding one instance-storage read per call. That read is
instance-local and costs the same in every contract; it is also what pushed a few
long-running integration tests past the default _test-host_ budget, which is why
`pool_factory`'s test `setup()` lifts that budget — see
[Batch Operations](#batch-operations).

### Measured Benchmarks: `deposit()` and `withdraw()` (SEP-41 mint/burn refactor)

In preparation for SEP-41 token interface compliance, `deposit()` and `withdraw()`'s internal LP share storage updates were refactored from inline writes into shared internal `mint()` and `burn()` helpers. Resource measurements were taken via Soroban SDK test environment budget tracking (`env.budget()` in `test_gas_benchmark_deposit_and_withdraw` in `contracts/pool/src/test.rs`):

| Operation    | Implementation                                   | CPU Instructions | Memory (Bytes) | Delta (CPU)     | Delta (Memory) |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| `deposit()`  | Inline `DataKey::LPShares` writes (pre-refactor) | 456,800          | 73,400         | Baseline        | Baseline       |
| `deposit()`  | Routed via `Self::mint()` (post-refactor)        | 457,992          | 73,495         | +1,192 (+0.26%) | +95 (+0.13%)   |
| `withdraw()` | Inline `DataKey::LPShares` writes (pre-refactor) | 450,500          | 63,550         | Baseline        | Baseline       |
| `withdraw()` | Routed via `Self::burn()` (post-refactor)        | 451,634          | 63,660         | +1,134 (+0.25%) | +110 (+0.17%)  |

The benchmark demonstrates negligible gas overhead (~0.25% CPU instruction delta from standard helper call frames) with zero regression to ledger write patterns or storage footprint.

### Budget Considerations

- `pool::fund_invoice` is the most expensive operation — it makes 6
  cross-contract calls (4 invoice reads + `escrow::lock` + `invoice::mark_funded`)
  and performs 1 token transfer. On a congested testnet, this may exceed the
  per-ledger resource limit.
- Read-only view functions (`get_stats`, `get`, `get_profile`, etc.) incur
  minimal cost as they only read from storage.
- Index enumeration functions (`get_by_status`, `get_by_issuer`,
  `get_by_buyer`) are paginated (`page`, `page_size`, capped at
  `MAX_PAGE_SIZE`), so each call hydrates a bounded number of invoices no
  matter how many entries the index holds (issue #71). Callers page until an
  empty result is returned. The status index is append-only, so a page can
  return fewer than `page_size` invoices when it contains stale entries whose
  invoice has since moved to another status.
- `get_invoice_count_by_issuer` and `get_invoice_count_by_buyer` avoid that
  cost entirely: they read a single stored counter (`u32`) in O(1), so
  pagination and badge UIs should prefer them over `.len()` on the
  full-fetch views.
- `registry::list_profiles` is bounded per call: it returns at most 50
  addresses (`PageSizeExceeded` above that, mirroring the 50-entry batch cap)
  and costs O(1) in `limit`, not in the total number of registered profiles.
  Read `registry::get_profile_count(role)` once to size the final page, then
  walk `start = 0, limit, 2 * limit, …` until a page comes back short. Each
  enumerated address costs one persistent entry plus its TTL bump, so a page of
  50 is roughly 50 reads — indexers that want thousands of addresses should
  page off-chain rather than in one call.

### Batch Operations

`invoice::batch_create`, `invoice::batch_list_for_financing`, and
`pool::batch_fund_invoice` bound their input at `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (50 entries)
with `BatchSizeExceeded` (`InvoiceError::28` / `PoolError::26`). The cap exists
so a caller cannot turn one transaction into an unbounded number of cross-contract
calls; a full 50-entry batch is the practical ceiling and can exceed the
per-ledger resource limit on a congested testnet. Callers that hit a budget
error should split the work across several transactions.

The three batch entry points deliberately differ in failure semantics, because
their failure modes differ:

| Entry point                | On a bad entry                      | Why                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `batch_create`             | Reverts the whole batch             | Creation consumes the shared `Counter`; a partial success would burn counter values and persist a prefix the caller cannot identify without re-reading every invoice |
| `batch_list_for_financing` | Skips the entry, returns its ID     | The interesting failures are per-invoice state an issuer listing a backlog cannot avoid (already listed, missing attestation, revoked verification)                  |
| `batch_fund_invoice`       | Stops the batch, returns funded IDs | A liquidity/utilization stop is a normal outcome when an LP fills the pool; partial funding would drain the pool in a way no single `fund_invoice` could             |

`batch_fund_invoice` still reverts on _eligibility_ errors (not listed, already
funded by this pool, unverified issuer/buyer, asset mismatch), because those are
caller mistakes that should be fixed rather than silently skipped. Callers
reconcile the returned funded IDs against their input to see which entries a
capacity stop skipped.

### Storing the `History` Vector

`escrow::append_history` stores a growable `Vec<EscrowEvent>` under
`DataKey::History(invoice_id)`. Each event adds an element without
compaction. For heavily-used contracts, this vector may grow large enough
to exceed the per-entry size limit (~100 KB in practice).

---

## Known Gaps

### LP Withdrawal Yield Uses Aggregate Principal

The pool stores one cumulative principal amount per LP rather than deposit
lots. A partial withdrawal allocates that amount pro rata across the LP's
remaining shares. This is an average-basis approximation, not FIFO or HIFO
accounting; after deposits at different share prices it can attribute a
different yield amount to a particular withdrawal. Total USDC returned and
pool share ownership are unaffected, but the LP's cumulative `yield_earned`
report can differ based on the chosen lot-accounting policy.

For example, an LP deposits 1,000 USDC, the pool gains 2%, then the LP deposits
another 1,000 USDC. Withdrawing 500 shares returns about 510 USDC. FIFO would
attribute 500 USDC principal and 10 USDC yield, while aggregate-basis
accounting records about 504.95 USDC principal and 5.05 USDC yield. The
roughly 4.95 USDC difference is about 49.5% of the FIFO yield for this
withdrawal. The regression test in `contracts/pool/src/test.rs` covers this
scenario. Per-deposit lots would be required if the protocol needs a specific
FIFO/HIFO tax or reporting policy.

### Issuer Release Not Wired (Issue #56)

After `fund_invoice` locks USDC in escrow, the pooled funds should be
released to the issuer via `escrow.release_to_issuer()`. This call is
**not yet wired** into `fund_invoice`. See
[Issue #56](https://github.com/TrusTrove/TrusTrove-contract/issues/56).
**Status:** Unresolved. This is the highest-priority gap before mainnet.
**Workaround:** An admin or automated off-chain bot must call
`escrow.release_to_issuer(invoice_id, issuer)` separately after funding.

### No Early Repayment Incentive Logic

The protocol does not apply dynamic discount rates based on how early
repayment occurs. The buyer pays the full `face_value` regardless of how
early they repay, so there is no on-chain rebate proportional to the time
remaining on the invoice.

### No Accessor for `funded_amount` on Invoice Contract

While `get_face_value`, `get_discount_bps`, and `get_funding_asset` are
exposed as per-field view functions (one storage read each), there is no
dedicated `get_funded_amount` accessor. Callers currently read the full
`Invoice` struct via `get()`.

### No Duplicate Invoice Detection

The `create` function generates an invoice ID from a SHA-256 hash of
(issuer, buyer, face_value, due_date, counter, asset). The counter
guarantees uniqueness even for otherwise identical invoices, but there is
no user-visible warning when an issuer re-submits the same commercial
terms.

## Resolved

These limitations were previously listed here but have been fixed since
the 2025-07-25 revision.

> **Correction (issue
> [#835](https://github.com/TrusTrove/TrusTrove-contract/issues/835)):**
> An earlier entry here claimed that "Index entries not compacted on status
> transition" was resolved because `move_status_index` performs O(1)
> membership checks via `DataKey::StatusMembership` (crediting PR #121).
> No such storage key exists anywhere in `contracts/invoice/src/lib.rs`.
> In reality `move_status_index` and the `extend_*_index` helpers linearly
> scan the index on every transition, index rows are still not compacted,
> and `get_by_status` skips stale rows only by loading each invoice and
> comparing its status. The item remains open and the O(n) linear-scan
> behaviour is tracked in
> [#831](https://github.com/TrusTrove/TrusTrove-contract/issues/831);
> this document will be updated again when that lands.

- **Pool does not track individual LP yield accrual.** `pool::withdraw`
  now writes `DataKey::LPYieldEarned(lp)` and `pool::get_lp_position`
  returns the running yield figure per LP. Yield is therefore visible
  before the LP triggers a withdrawal.
- **Partial default-side repayment.** `escrow::release_to_pool` accepts
  a `repayment_amount` that may be less than the original locked amount,
  keeps the residual escrow record in place, and emits history events
  per partial release. See PR #120
  (`feat/partial-repayment-default-flow`). Buyer-driven partial
  repayments via `invoice.repay` remain a future-feature — see
  [Known Gaps](#known-gaps).
- **Security findings #94, #96, #98, #103.** Addressed together in
  PR #124 (`fix: address security issues #94, #96, #98, #103`).
